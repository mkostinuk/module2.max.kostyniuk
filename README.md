*The project is a programmed island model with variable parameters*
  
All data, from the size of the island and ending with the properties of animals are stored in the property in resources

Also added primitive logging(log4j2), which logs changes in the life of animals in the file and console and lombok

The project may still be in a long development, because the possible development is almost limitless (addition of different plant species, reproduction of animals depending on the article, change in animal behavior, weather conditions, GUI, etc.)
